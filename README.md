## ðŸ“– Overview

Understanding the neural basis of neurodevelopmental disorders is critical for early diagnosis and intervention. This project leverages advanced computational methods to analyze brain connectivity and classify subjects based on their clinical conditions. It combines both domain knowledge from neuroscience and data-driven machine learning approaches to enhance diagnostic accuracy and explore the mechanisms underlying these conditions.

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts

### What is Functional Connectivity?

Functional connectivity (FC) is a measure of the temporal synchronization between spatially distinct regions of the brain. It provides insights into the functional architecture of the brain by analyzing patterns of correlated activity in resting-state fMRI data. 

#### Characteristics of FC:
- **Static Functional Connectivity (sFC)**: Measures consistent, long-term correlations across the entire duration of the fMRI scan.
- **Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC)**: Captures temporal fluctuations in connectivity by analyzing overlapping "windows" of time series data. This method is particularly suited to studying transient brain states and their association with clinical conditions.

#### Methodology:
- Correlation matrices are computed from fMRI time series using a predefined brain atlas(AAL3) with 166 regions of interest (ROIs).
- Only positive correlations are used for analysis, as negative correlations are challenging to interpret clinically.

### What is fc-MVPA?

Functional connectivity-based multivariate pattern analysis (fc-MVPA) is a framework that uses statistical and machine learning methods to analyze patterns within FC data for prediction or classification. It is particularly suited for neuroimaging studies that aim to link brain connectivity to behavioral or clinical outcomes.

Especially, the use of non-parametric statistical tests for feature selection is a distinctive aspect of this study. By employing methods such as the Mann-Whitney U test, features were ranked based on their statistical significance rather than relying solely on traditional machine learning feature selection algorithms. This approach demonstrated that even using purely statistical methods, it is possible to achieve competitive classification performance. Specifically, the statistical feature selection approach yielded comparable or superior results to baseline methods that utilized random or heuristic feature selection, underscoring the efficacy of clinically informed, data-driven statistical methodologies in identifying meaningful connectivity patterns.

#### Components:
1. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Full correlation matrices are used as the input data.
   - Features are derived from ROI-to-ROI connectivity values.
   - This repository does not include the preprocessing pipeline of fMRI data, since the experiment was conducted with ROI - time series data formerly extracted by SNUH clinicians.
   
2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Data-driven approaches: Nonparametrical Statistic techniques (e.g., Mann-Whitney U test)

3. **Classification**:
   - Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), are trained to classify clinical groups (e.g., ADHD vs. TD, ASD vs. TD).

4. **Confounding Variable Removal**:
   - Propensity score matching (PSM) is applied to address potential biases due to confounding variables, such as age and sex.

## ðŸ“– Pipeline

The project follows a structured analysis pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Correlation matrices are generated from ROI time series using a brain atlas with 166 parcellations.
   - Positive correlations are retained after Fisher Z-transformation.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Features are ranked based on statistical significance and clinical relevance.
   - High-ranking features are progressively added to models to optimize performance.

3. **Classification**:
   - Machine learning models (e.g., SVM) are trained and validated on selected features.
   - Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy and AUC.

4. **Dynamic Functional Connectivity Analysis**:
   - Sliding window techniques are applied with varying window sizes and steps (e.g., window size = 30/60, step = 5/30).
   - Temporal variability in connectivity is analyzed to identify dynamic biomarkers.

5. **Confounding Variable Removal**:
   - Propensity score matching is employed to address demographic biases, ensuring the comparability of clinical groups.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Classification results are evaluated against baseline models using both static and dynamic connectivity features.
   - Feature importance is visualized using tools like BrainNet Viewer.

## ðŸ“– Dataset

The study dataset consists of resting-state fMRI scans from three groups:
1. ADHD group (146 cases after preprocessing).
2. ASD group (116 cases after preprocessing).
3. TD group (131 cases after preprocessing).

#### Demographics:
- Age range: ASD group is significantly younger (mean = 4.9 years) compared to ADHD and TD groups (mean â‰ˆ 9 years).
- Sex distribution: Balanced across groups, removing significant gender biases.
